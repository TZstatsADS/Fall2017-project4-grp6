+ Project summary: For this project, we implemented different collaborative filtering algorithms on 2 datasets and evaluated the performances. Our team worked on:
	- Similarity weight - Spearman
	- Similarity weight - Vector Similarity
	- Similarity weight - Mean Square Difference
	- Similarity weight - SimRank
	- Variance weighting - Spearman
	- Variance weighting - Vector Similarity
	- Selecting Neighbors - Weight Threshold
	- Selecting Neighbors - Best-n-estimator
	- Selecting Neighbors - Combined
	- Rating normalization: Z-score
	- Cluster models
